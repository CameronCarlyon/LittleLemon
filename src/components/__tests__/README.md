## Testing Philosophy

This test suite employs a **reliability-focused approach** that prioritizes:

1. **Smoke Testing**: Verifying core functionality works without complex mocking
2. **User-Centric Testing**: Testing from the user's perspective rather than implementation details
3. **Maintainable Tests**: Simple, readable tests that are easy to understand and modify
4. **Professional Standards**: Industry-standard naming conventions and clear test descriptions

## Technology Stack

- **React Testing Library**: For component rendering and user interaction simulation
- **Jest**: Test framework with built-in assertions and test runner
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Additional DOM-specific matchers

## Test Execution

All tests are designed to run reliably without external dependencies or complex setup requirements. The suite focuses on functional verification rather than implementation testing, ensuring tests remain stable as the codebase evolves.

## Coverage Areas

- ✅ Component rendering verification
- ✅ User interaction handling
- ✅ Form functionality validation
- ✅ Content display verification
- ✅ Navigation structure testing
- ✅ Accessibility compliance checking

This testing approach demonstrates best practices for React application testing while maintaining simplicity and reliability for long-term maintenance.
